# ValkyRiver: MOS Spectrum Viewer
**MOS Spectrum Viewer** is a visualization for MOS (moment-of-symmetry) scales and where each equal temperament fits on its step ratio spectrum.

## MOS scales
**MOS scales** have the property that every step size other than the period must come in exactly two sizes. They are commonly denotes x_L_ y_s_, where the _L_ and _s_ refer to the large and small step respectively. For a x_L_ y_L_s scale, the period is 1/GCD(x, y) of an octave (so if x and y are coprime, then the period will be a full octave).

Each MOS has two **generator** intervals where repeatedly stacking it will produce all notes of the scale, modulo period. These two generators are period-inversions of each other.
There is a range that this generator can be in.

On one extreme, the small step becomes so big that it equals the large step (**equalized**). On the other extreme, the small step goes to 0 (**collapsed**).
